### Contributing

To develop on this site, you need `npm` and `hugo`.

To run locally:

1. Install npm dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

2. serve hugo to local host

```shell
hugo server
```

We have a few customizations, but all the hard work for creating this theme was done by the good people at Doks:
https://github.com/h-enk/doks/

## Important directories:

- The Homepage is in the `layouts/index.html`
- Content templates go in `archetypes`
- `layouts` contains all information about templates
- `config/_default/menus.toml` contains the structure for the overall menu and the section menus

## How to add menu items

Open up `config/_default/menus.toml`.

If you want to add a head section, add a config to [[main]].

```TOML
[[main]]
  name = "Docs"
  url = "/docs/prologue/introduction/"
  weight = 10

```

The more "weight", the farther to the left it will be.

Then change some files in `layouts`. Check out the files the template owner changed here.

If you want to add a subsection, it will look like this under `[[<section-name>]]`

```
[[docs]]
  name = "Tools"
  weight = 20
  identifier = "tools"
  url = "/docs/concepts/"
```

The more weight it has, the farther down the section will be.

When you create content, you probably want to create corresponding directories in `content`.

## Adding pages
In `content` directory, create a new one. In the new directory, add a file called `_index.md`. The name must start with `_`, unless
you only need one page. If you need subpages, you add them to the same directory.

The new page will use the default layout. It may happen that it goes into "list" mode (the text content is not displayed and part of it is rendered as headers). In such a case, add `layout: single` in front matter.
If you need a different layout for the pages, create a new directory in `layouts` using the same name as in `content`.
