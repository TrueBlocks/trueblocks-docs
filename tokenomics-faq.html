<ul style="margin-left: -20px;"><li><b>What even is this website?</b><br>
<div>Access to the Gitcoin Grants data from two perspectives. First, from the perspective of the<br>
smart contracts. The second is from the perspective of the individual grants. The website is an<br>
experiment in monitoring and presenting the activity on a large collection of addresses in a fully<br>
permissionless way that we call <i>ecosystem accounting</i>. This code runs on a desktop computer<br>
with access to a node.</div></li><li>
<b>May I download the entire data dump in a single file?</b><br>
<div>Currently no, but it's on our list of things to do. <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://github.com/TrueBlocks/tokenomics.io">Dive in and help us</a>.</div></li>
<li><b>What does your infrastructure look like? Are you running your own Ethereum nodes?</b><br>
<div>Currently, we run two OpenEthereum archive nodes in-house (switching to <a href="http://twitter.com/@turbogeth">TurboGeth</a> soon).<br>
Five years ago, we made a capital investment of about $5,000 for two "hefty" Linux computers.<br>
Since them, we've upgraded twice to increase the hard-drive space (Raid 0, 12 TB, SSD). We<br>
also pay about $30.00 US per month for this Digital Ocean server.</div></li>
<li><b>Why do you only export event logs?</b><br>
<div>People are most familiar with logs, plus their analytical piplines already handle that type of data.<br>
The full suite of TrueBlocks tools produces much more data, though. Full tranactional details,<br>
full tracing data, and even full ETH accounting are available, but we do not include that data on<br>
this website at this time.</div></li>
<li><b>What's hard about what you did?</b><br>
<ul style="margin-left: -20px;"><li>The data comes directly from an Ethereum node.</li><li>Without TrueBlocks, getting this same data <i><u>from a node</u></i> takes WEEKS!</li><li>TrueBlocks core runs on our Mac desktop using zero third-party APIs.</li><li>There are no databases to install or maintain. Local-first baby.</li><li>Perfect privacy. We ask no-one's permission, get no API keys, complete no logins.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Why did you build the data pouch?</b><br>
<div>Five years ago we fell in love with the idea of per-block, 18-decimal-place-accurate<br>
permissionless, radically-transparent balance sheets and profit-and-loss statements. At<br>
TrueBlocks, we are trying to build on that dream. Recently, we've expanded the idea<br>
into something we call <i>ecosystem accounting</i> which means accounting for community-wide<br>
constellations of inter-related Ethereum addresses such as the GitCoin grant community.</div></li></ul>
